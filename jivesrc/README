This tree is the LGPL portion of Jive's TinyMCE source.  Our development
model is different from the normal TinyMCE model, in that we hack on
tiny_mce_src.js directly, which is actually a build artifact of the normal
TinyMCE build process. I don't really recommend this, but it's what we do.

At some point, we'd like to move back to making source changes in the
classes tree (not least because it would dramatically simplify upstream
pulls), but adding another build step to our development process isn't
something we're terribly excited about, so we keep putting it off.
So it goes.

Apart from various bug fixes to core plugins, Jive's changes include a
plugin for selection management that makes Firefox's text cursor behave
in a predictable and user-friendly manner (simplifying various formatting
operations) and a list plugin that smoothes over most of the bugs in
various browser's nested list operations.
